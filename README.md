# qr-code-activator

Proof of concept...
Imagine you need to conduct a survey on traffic use along a path with detailed information about time of day usage, current weather, etc. 
You could set up a survey along your route and ask people to fill out the survey. This approach reduces the effort required by the participant 
while capturing spatial/temporal data since you can pre-fill that information yourself. 
However, participants may be less likely to have time during peak hours, so alternatively you can provide a take home survey, but you will need to be careful to differentiate data from these two sources when you evaluate the data later because the take home survey doesn't capture the same spatial/temporal data.

This project creates single use qr codes which can be linked to a take home survey but will bind additional data to capture spatial/temporal data
